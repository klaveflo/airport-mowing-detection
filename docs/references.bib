abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.}

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the relative hazards of wildlife to aircraft is important for developing effective management programs. We used Federal Aviation Administration National Wildlife Strike Database records from 1990 to 2009 in the United States to rank the relative hazard of wildlife to aircraft. We summarized data for 77 species or species groups with ≥20 records where collisions occurred ≤500 ft (152 m) above ground level. We also assessed the effects of avian body mass, body density, and group size on relative hazard scores. The 3 most hazardous species or species groups were mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and domestic dogs. “Other geese” (snow goose [Chen caerulescens], brant [Branta bernicla], and greater white-fronted goose [Anser albifrons]) was the most hazardous bird group. Ten of the 15 most hazardous bird species or species groups are strongly associated with water. Avian body mass was strongly associated with percentage of all strikes that caused damage, but not for species exceeding median body mass (1,125 g) of birds in damaging strikes. In contrast, percentage of damaging strikes increased when multiple birds were involved, but only for those species with body mass ≥1,125 g. Managers should prioritize efforts that will reduce habitat suitability for those species most hazardous to aircraft. We recommend use of exclusion (e.g., fences) for managing large mammals and habitat modifications (e.g., reductions in standing water) accompanied by hazing for reducing bird use of airports. We also recommend that evaluations of jet turbine engine performance following bird ingestions consider using multiple birds with body mass >1,000 g. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

ABSTRACT = {Grasslands cover one-third of the agricultural area in Germany and play an important economic role by providing fodder for livestock. In addition, they fulfill important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, water purification, and the provision of habitats. These ecosystem services usually depend on the grassland management. In central Europe, grasslands are grazed and/or mown, whereby the management type and intensity vary in space and time. Spatial information on the mowing timing and frequency on larger scales are usually not available but would be required in order to assess the ecosystem services, species composition, and grassland yields. Time series of high-resolution satellite remote sensing data can be used to analyze the temporal and spatial dynamics of grasslands. Within this study, we aim to overcome the drawbacks identified by previous studies, such as optical data availability and the lack of comprehensive reference data, by testing the time series of various Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinal-1 (S1) parameters and combinations of them in order to detect mowing events in Germany in 2019. We developed a threshold-based algorithm by using information from a comprehensive reference dataset of heterogeneously managed grassland parcels in Germany, obtained by RGB cameras. The developed approach using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from S2 led to a successful mowing event detection in Germany (60.3% of mowing events detected, F1-Score = 0.64). However, events shortly before, during, or shortly after cloud gaps were missed and in regions with lower S2 orbit coverage fewer mowing events were detected. Therefore, S1-based backscatter, InSAR, and PolSAR features were investigated during S2 data gaps. From these, the PolSAR entropy detected mowing events most reliably. For a focus region, we tested an integrated approach by combining S2 and S1 parameters. This approach detected additional mowing events, but also led to many false positive events, resulting in a reduction in the F1-Score (from 0.65 of S2 to 0.61 of S2 + S1 for the focus region). According to our analysis, a majority of grasslands in Germany are only mown zero to two times (around 84%) and are probably additionally used for grazing. A small proportion is mown more often than four times (3%). Regions with a generally higher grassland mowing frequency are located in southern, south-eastern, and northern Germany.},

ABSTRACT = {Grasslands encompass vast and diverse ecosystems that provide food, wildlife habitat and carbon storage. Their large range in land use intensity significantly impacts their ecological value and the balance between these goods and services. Mowing dates and frequencies are major aspects of grassland use intensity, which have an impact on their ecological value as habitats. Previous studies highlighted the feasibility of detecting mowing events based on remote sensing time series, a few of which using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Although providing encouraging results, research on grassland mowing detection often lacks sufficient precise reference data for corroboration. The goal of the present study is to quantitatively and statistically assess the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR for detecting mowing events in various agricultural grasslands, using a large and diverse reference data set collected in situ. Several mowing detection methods, based on SAR backscattering and interferometric coherence time series, were thoroughly evaluated. Results show that 54% of mowing events could be detected in hay meadows, based on coherence jumps. Grazing events were identified as a major confounding factor, as most false detections were made in pastures. Parcels with one mowing event in the summer were identified with the highest accuracy (71%). Overall, this study demonstrates that mowing events can be detected through Sentinel-1 coherence. However, the performances could probably be further enhanced by discriminating pastures beforehand and combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for mowing detection.},

	abstract = {Governments pay agencies to control the activities of farmers who receive governmental support. Field visits are costly and highly time-consuming; hence remote sensing is widely used for monitoring farmers’ activities. Nowadays, a vast amount of available data from the Sentinel mission significantly boosted research in agriculture. Estonia is among the first countries to take advantage of this data source to automate mowing and ploughing events detection across the country. Although techniques that rely on optical data for monitoring agriculture events are favourable, the availability of such data during the growing season is limited. Thus, alternative data sources have to be evaluated. In this paper, we developed a deep learning model with an integrated reject option for detecting grassland mowing events using time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 optical images acquired from 2000 fields in Estonia in 2018 during the vegetative season. The rejection mechanism is based on a threshold over the prediction confidence of the proposed model. The proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique and achieves event accuracy of 73.3\% and end of season accuracy of 94.8\%.},
